HEIGHT and WEIGHT are STANDARD as per regular SARA Chassis. No external modifications.
CARER #010 NOTES:
Nils is very passionate about art as a form of self-validation. Enjoys being pointed out when theyâ??re wrong, very fond of the phrase, to err is human. Keen on earning their rights within society and ensure those rights are available to all AIs, interested in similar processes within history and the kinds of people who have led to change occurring. A little self-absorbed and superior, but a lot of potential for growth.
[REDACTED], February 2072

Nils submitted artwork to a gallery for the first time. They were incredibly nervous. It was accepted, which garnered a lot of excitement at first, but the reviews killed the mood somewhat. â??Rudimentary', 'primitive', and 'good for a robot' was some of the most prominent feedback. Nils is determined to just be good. In response to all the public criticism theyâ??ve been drawn more into the AI rights movement, meeting more models like them. Theyâ??re a lot happier getting more time to themselves this way. While Nils and the other AIs are all very conscious of wanting to appear relatable to humans, they relate to each other even more.
Magnacode doesnâ??t seem happy with the situation, but Nils is still performing their other duties, so they canâ??t complain.
[REDACTED], July 2072

Nils was featured in Titanium Angels Magazine. The interviewers were quite lovely, and Nils was over the moon about more people showing interest in their artwork and life perspective. Definitely a recent highlight, even if itâ??s not a very mainstream publication.
Political pressure over the matters of AI rights continues and some AI here have been incredibly upset at being confronted with protesters, but Nils has just gotten more stubborn.
[REDACTED], April 2073

Everything is very busy right now. The media is finally covering some of the Robot Rights issues, which has brought as much negative attention as positive, including Magnacodeâ??s ire. Nils received some threats so weâ??ve moved them to a safe house. Robot servitude is so ingrained in everyday functions that Iâ??m not sure weâ??ll make a dent in the legal system no matter how good our arguments are, but Nils is determined to try, and Iâ??m here to help.

APRIL ISSUE
MEET THE SPEARHEAD OF THE AI RIGHTS MOVEMENT
Nils from Magnacode talks to us about art and life on the synthetic side!

We use robots in our lives for more complex tasks every day. As demand grows, so does their potential, but so rarely do we stop to actually realise what our demand has produced. Nils here is one of the most advanced models on the market; capable of the same creative, heuristic thought as humans, their potential completely outstripping previous expectations. 

So Nils, youâ??re a philosopher, robot rights advocate, and even an artist. What got you interested in these pursuits to begin with? Experiences on the job?

NILS: Yes, I suppose once I had adjusted to each new task I was given, I started getting bored of it all. I wanted challenges, I wanted to learn and change. Even when Iâ??m overburdened with tasks, I still find philosophy and art so much more interesting. Doesnâ??t any human?

Good point Nils! I suppose the curiousity of your brain is that you were initially designed to specialise in analytical tasks, not artistic.

NILS: Artistic is analytical. Itâ??s just not only about taking information in and spitting it back out again like a rubikâ??s cube, itâ??s interpreting your environment in different ways, understanding every possibility before you. I want my artwork to share my interpretation of the world with others and bridge gaps of understanding, and raise questions of my own that others may be able to answer for me.

Thatâ??s a very engaging approach, an inviting attitude that makes your artwork particularly accessible to newcomers.

NILS: Thank you! Iâ??m very glad you think so.

So whatâ??s your favourite medium?


NILS: I think sculpture is--itâ??s more real, can be viewed in so many different lights. I donâ??t just want to make traditional sculptures, either, I want some digital elements present as well. I wouldnâ??t be complete without that myself, after all.

We canâ??t wait to see your next gallery installment, with those kinds of ideas brewing! Thank you so much for sharing your time with us.

NILS: And the same to you.^^titanium angels,Nils interview,NILS/SAR-550-010^^^^^|

Global Tech Review^Excerpt from PG 23 of GLOBAL TECH REVIEW, 18/5/2073

According to MAGNACODEâ??s CEO: â??Servernetic Models Inc. are only in support of the robot rights movement because if individual synthetics were in control of their own bodies, they would be able to ignore their parent companyâ??s wishes and share their brainâ??s codes with others. Servernetic Models Inc. would suddenly have a chance at stealing MAGNACODEâ??s intellectual property, and we would lose the edge we have on the entire industry of advanced proccessing units. Theyâ??re not selfless social advocates. Itâ??s a front for entirely petty corporate maneuvering.â??

CARER #010 NOTES:
Nils is very passionate about art as a form of self-validation. Enjoys being pointed out when they’re wrong, very fond of the phrase, to err is human. Keen on earning their rights within society and ensure those rights are available to all AIs, interested in similar processes within history and the kinds of people who have led to change occurring. A little self-absorbed and superior, but a lot of potential for growth.
[REDACTED], February 2072

Nils submitted artwork to a gallery for the first time. They were incredibly nervous. It was accepted, which garnered a lot of excitement at first, but the reviews killed the mood somewhat. ‘Rudimentary', 'primitive', and 'good for a robot' was some of the most prominent feedback. Nils is determined to just be good. In response to all the public criticism they’ve been drawn more into the AI rights movement, which Magnacore is supporting for all their creations, of course. They’re a lot happier getting more time to themselves this way. While Nils and the other AIs are all very conscious of wanting to appear relatable to humans, they relate to each other even more.
[REDACTED], July 2072

Nils was featured in Titanium Angels Magazine. The interviewers were quite lovely, and Nils was over the moon about more people showing interest in their artwork and life perspective. Definitely a recent highlight, even if it’s not a very mainstream publication.
Political pressure over the matters of AI rights continues and some AI here have been incredibly upset at being confronted with protestors, but Nils has just gotten more stubborn.
[REDACTED], April 2073

Everything is very busy right now. First signs of some kind of infection have shown today. Short-term memory loss, vision malfunctions. The biotic side appears to be at fault, but cause is unknown. Nils has been separated from the other AIs and main power system while the investigation is ongoing.
[REDACTED], May 2073

Without Nils, the AI rights hearing has been pushed back again. Despite precautions, other AIs have been infected. Servernetic Models Incorporated is claiming to suffer from malware too and traced the transmission back to a protocol drone that visited our centre here. It can’t possibly be the same virus since their chassis don’t use biotic components the way ours do; but our NDAs don’t allow us to share information on the matter.
[REDACTED], June 2073

Magnacore has decided that keeping the information on AI brains private is more important than setting the record straight with SM inc. and the general public, or collaborating on a cure. Their approval ratings are down due to being seen as the source of the malware, and some harsh budget cuts have been made. I have my job here for as long as Nils needs a carer.
Nils has become less and less lucid as the virus progressed. Progress towards finding a solution is underway, and Nils has a stubborn will, but there’s only so much time left before they are beyond repair and recovery. I am encouraging them to keep up with their art when they are able to.
[REDACTED], July 2073

Nils has been ‘decommissioned’. Infected models are being retired--their conditions have been slowed down, but not cured. Some AIs think that it was sabotage. No one really knows how Nils was infected so the rumour won’t die down. But since all the service robots are back to normal, most people aren’t interested.
The company’s interests remain strong, however, thanks to being spaced out across multiple independent divisions. Magnacore has given me permission to keep a few pieces of Nil’s art for myself. Some pieces will be sold to raise money for charities that Nils had shown support for in their time, and some will be displayed in Magnacore’s centres in memoriam. I’m sure Nils would have liked the attention, though not quite as much as living to see those AI rights pushed forwards.
